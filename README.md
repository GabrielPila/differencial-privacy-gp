# differencial-privacy-gp
Differential privacy experiments, paper implementation and library testing 

The first notebook consists of 3 parts:
1. IBM diffprivlib library testing: It shows how the noise added can affect the accuracy of the model.
2. Paper Implementation: It creates functions and the needed code to replicate the results shown in the paper (Lee-2011).
3. Synthetic data generation: It uses the functions developed for the paper implementation to create synthetic data based on the Iris dataset.
